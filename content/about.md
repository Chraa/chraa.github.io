title: About Me
description: Patric Wallin
---

I am a professional security consultant with penetration testing as main focus.
On this site i will share both security-related material but also maintain articles and videos made on my spare time, which might include Mountainbiking and Discgolfing.

My base is just outside of Gothenburg in Sweden.

Cheers.
